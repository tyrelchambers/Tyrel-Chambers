        <p>Born on July 9th, 1992, I came out of the womb with a controller in my hands and a CPU as a heart. My passion for gaming, and computers in general, exploded when I knew what my hands were and how they could use a controller to manipulate an on-screen object. It was a fantastic time! </p>
        <p>My first console, if I can remember correctly, was a Sega Genesis. I had a lot of fun on that thing, spent many hours playing Sonic. My next two consoles were the PSX and XBox, both at the same time too. My uncle you could say was a great influence on my dad's gaming habits, he was the first one to get the XBox and Halo as well. My family was an avid fan of the Halo series when it first came out. We spent many hours playing splitscreen, wrecking each others faces virtually.</p>
        <p>My hobbies now include PC gaming and playing sports games on my XBox One, NHL 16 in particular. I also spend a lot of time doing various other things, programming, learning new things, playing sports!</p>
        <p>My education includes a diploma in Security and Risk Management. That wasn't of any interest to me, so now I spend many hours a week learning new programming languages; mainly learning JavaScript and the MEAN Stack. Being a self-taught front-end developer and back-end developer is a tough job! It's hard to find the right practices for writing code and new techniques. It becomes hard to learn new things without the help of a group. The best group of people I have joined is DevTips. It can be found on YouTube, where there are many informational videos to help newcomers get a hold in this industry; check them out!</p>
        <p>With that said, welcome to my site, and feel free to stay a while! P.S. I love landscape/nature photos!</p>
