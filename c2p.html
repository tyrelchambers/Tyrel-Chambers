After having been fiddling with web development technologies for the better part of a year, I got brought onto a team, or into a startup company I should say, with the role of making a website! I used very basic methods and the html is probably a mess, but I learned a lot and loved every bit of it.</p><div class="c2p-1"></div></div><div class="work-2-main"><div class="c2p-2"></div><p>This project was a real stretch. Having just broken onto the scene with web technologies, I had a pretty big task ahead of me. Combining patience, time, effort and everything other cliche thing, I produced this website. It was the first time I had used a preprocessor (SCSS) and a workflow automater (gulp). This is my first published site and I know it will get better from here.</p></div></main></section><script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="bower_components/jquery-ui/jquery-ui.min.js"></script><script src="scripts/jquery.js"></script></body></html>
